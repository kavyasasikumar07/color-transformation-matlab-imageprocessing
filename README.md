An image transform can be applied to an image to convert it from one domain to another. Viewing an image in domains such as frequency or Hough space enables the identification of features that may not be as easily detected in the spatial domain.
Need to convert gray image:The main reason why grayscale representations are often used for extracting descriptors instead of operating on color images directly is that grayscale simplifies the algorithm and reduces computational requirements.
